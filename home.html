<!-- bonuses: random start up sequence with pulsating lights - http://jsoverson.github.io/jquery.pulse.js/

level up functionality - how would the extra size board work - from visual and logic perspective?? - logic done, now consider visual. 

pulsating lights - http://jsoverson.github.io/jquery.pulse.js/
rotate lights
make responsive

logic so that if reset the messages change to something different than loadup messages.

ambient background which gradually changes colors
on click flip the tiles and their relative ones with jquery animations

split the code up into smaller scripts? 

if game won twice (by p1 and p2) then 

jquery flip on clicked tile?

counter for remaining tiles left

animate the remaining tiles and turn numbers by making them bold on each mouse click

sound retro beep on mouse click
sounds short click on mouse hover

scrolling baclground image

on win, the tiles fade Out and a z-index hidden div comes up to congratulate user


//work out how player 2 will play - player 1 goes first and after the first click a timer starts counting down. player 1's turn will end once the timer has run out, at which point their turn score will be logged to compare against player 2's if neither manages to win) . if the timer runs out before the hasWon function has returned true then player ones turn has ended and its onto player two.

//add timer function which starts from the first mouse click. then wokrk out how the game is actually won - ie by least number of moves? or by best time with completed
// add a reset board button 
UX:

on load, create a div which covers most of screen explaining instructions and an okay button. On button click fade the div into the background/change the z-index. alternatively instead of okay button have a button which chooses grid size.

sketch how i want page to look with what interactive features- scoreboards, links to social media - tweet your score, player indicator, animations, z-index hidden divs and how they come onto & off screen.
