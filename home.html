    <h1 id="title"><strong>litesweeper</strong></h1><br><br>

    <p id="score"> click the board to start</p><br>

    <ul class="grid">

    </ul>  

  </div>

  <div id="reset">click to reset</div><br><br>

  <div id="instructions">the <strong>aim of the game</strong> is to turn the board from green to red by pressing on the lites. There's a twist though - each click will toggle the clicked lite and also its adjacent lites green/red. The board needs to be all green to win before you run out of clicks. Good luck!</div>

<!-- contains log of required next steps:

issues - can't restart and size another grid as the main code block isnt being executed  - would it work if i wrap main code in function and then call the function everytime a reset/board size change call was initiated?

font doesnt work when deployed onto heroku

1 - add z index divs which fade in and out - consider UX for when to make divs visible and with what content.

3. user experience flow - sketch out how i want page to look like, (consider responsive too)
on load, create a div which covers most of screen explaining instructions and an okay button. On button click fade the div into the background/change the z-index. alternatively instead of okay button have a button which chooses grid size.

sketch how i want page to look with what interactive features- scoreboards, links to social media - tweet your score, player indicator, animations, z-index hidden divs and how they come onto & off screen.

add a drop down instruction menu style UI. use slideTOggle
add dropdown menu for grid sizes
these dd menues should resize for mobile view

4. animation:
  a.when hasWon is true (ie when you;ve won) make all the squares in the grid flash.
  b) when you win a message cascades across screen and then fades out
  c) consider other animations based on flow of how user would interact.

5. sound: use a constructor to create audio instance objects and assign to click events
  b) sound retro beep on mouse click
  sounds short click on mouse hover

6. how the game should actually work - ie. do you run out of turns?  if so how many? how does player 2 come into the mix? one idea is to have a turn counter which counts down and displays the clicks left for level. if level completed (all green) before this turn counter is up then level is won and score is logged. then p2's turn. if player 2 also wins then compare their turns left score and decide winner. then move onto the next level (ie. increase grid size). 
  a) add turns remaining feature. DONE
  b) add add a scoreboard div which contains p tags for player 1 and player 2 scores. update these with 
  c) add a banner which displays which players turn it is - ie. player 1

d) HOW ABOUT A MULTIPLAYER (as many as you want as you enter name each time.) GAME WHERE YOU ENTER YOUR NAME EACH TURN AND YOUR SCORE IS APPENDED TO THE LEADERBOARD?!

9. styling
  a) fonts.
  b) color themes: dark background -black grey hues. grid looks much better like this! further note. add a couple of bright colors in there which wont clash with red or green.
  c) improve styling of the lights

easter eggs:

switch color scheme mode.
make button presses look better.
logic so that if reset the messages change to something different than loadup messages.
scrolling background image?
on win header gets biggers and flies into middle of screen.
an ambient color changer based upon the click/tilesRemaining ratio - will change depending on ratio
