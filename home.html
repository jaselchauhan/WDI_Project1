  <div id="instructions">the <strong>aim of the game</strong> is to turn the board from green to red by pressing on the lites. There's a twist though - each click will toggle the clicked lite and also its adjacent lites green/red. The board needs to be all green to win before you run out of clicks. Good luck!</div><br><br><br>

1 - add z index divs which fade in and out - consider UX for when to make divs visible and with what content.

2 - user flow

  a) welcome screen is a blank div sitting below title area and contains buttons for selecting 3X3, 4X$, 5X5, 6X6, 7X7, 8X8 etc
  enters their name in playerName input box and clicks on which grid size to choose from. 

  b) welcome screen fades and the game screen becomes visible, ready for game to begin. Log the player's name onscreen somewhere.

  c) if player runs out of clicks in turn, a live is lost. after 3 lives lost the game is over and the playername, score and level are logged onto a scoreaboard. consider animation. and responsive design here.

  c2) if a player wins then log the clicks remaining and add it to a score variable, then move to the next grid size.

  d) welcome screen pops up ready for game to begin again.



add a drop down instruction menu style UI. use slideTOggle
add dropdown menu for grid sizes
these dd menues should resize for mobile view

4. animation, sounds and styling:
  a.when hasWon is true (ie when you;ve won) make all the squares in the grid flash.
  b) when you win a message cascades across screen and then fades out
  c) consider other animations based on flow of how user would interact.
  sounds short click on mouse hover.
  sound for win.
  sound for reset.

  b) color themes for ambient background: dark background -black grey hues. grid looks much better like this! further note. add a couple of bright colors in there which wont clash with red or green.

easter eggs:

switch color scheme mode.
make button presses look better.
logic so that if reset the messages change to something different than loadup messages.
scrolling background image?
on win header gets biggers and flies into middle of screen.
an ambient color changer based upon the click/tilesRemaining ratio - will change depending on ratio
