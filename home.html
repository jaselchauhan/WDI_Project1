  <div id="instructions">the <strong>aim of the game</strong> is to turn the board from red to green by pressing on the lites. There's a twist though - each click will toggle the clicked lite and also its adjacent lites green/red. The board needs to be all green to win before you run out of clicks. You have 3 lives and can reset the board if you wish but it'll cost you a life. Good luck!</div><br><br><br>

<!-- log

issues - 

one extra click is required to register you've run out of clicks. ie. the counter says 0 and yet you need to click once more to get the welcome message back

logic is broken once lives is 0 - message still begins with wise deciosn. need control flow in code to say if lives = 0 say another message.

when you run out of lives display a new message and allso make scoreboard float intomiddle of screen



                    __          __                              
   ____  ___  _  __/ /_   _____/ /____  ____  _____             
  / __ \/ _ \| |/_/ __/  / ___/ __/ _ \/ __ \/ ___/  ______     
 / / / /  __/>  </ /_   (__  ) /_/  __/ /_/ (__  )  /_____/     
/_/ /_/\___/_/|_|\__/  /____/\__/\___/ .___/____/               
                                    /_/                         


2. game logic - add the score and level completed to an array/obj where it can 

3. add a toggle which displays the grid size selector.

1 - user flow


  c) if player runs out of clicks in turn, a live is lost. after 3 lives lost the game is over and the playername, score and level are logged onto a scoreaboard. consider animation. and responsive design here.

  c2) if a player wins then log the clicks remaining and add it to a score variable so you can compare against P2. then reset to welcome screeen

  d) welcome screen pops up ready for game to begin again.

add a drop down instruction menu style UI. use slideTOggle
add dropdown menu for grid sizes
these dd menus should resize for mobile view

4. animation, sounds and styling:
  a.when hasWon is true (ie when you;ve won) make all the squares in the grid flash.
  b) when you win a message cascades across screen and then fades out
  c) consider other animations based on flow of how user would interact.
  sounds short click on mouse hover.
  sound for win.
  sound for reset.
  sound for lose
  sound on start
  d)monserrat font chain for backup fonts.

  // function clickSound(){
  //   var audio = document.getElementById("clickSound");
  //   audio.play();
  // } 

  b) color themes for ambient background: dark background -black grey hues. grid looks much better like this! further note. add a couple of bright colors in there which wont clash with red or green.



easter eggs:

switch color scheme mode.
make button presses look better.
logic so that if reset the messages change to something different than loadup messages.
scrolling background image?
on win header gets biggers and flies into middle of screen.
an ambient color changer based upon the click/tilesRemaining ratio - will change depending on ratio
