<!-- bonuses: random start up sequence with pulsating lights - http://jsoverson.github.io/jquery.pulse.js/

issues - can't restart and size another grid as the main code block isnt being executed

1 - add z index divs which fade in and out - consider UX for when to make divs visible and with what content.

2.



a name! go green? 

when hasWon is true (ie when you;ve won) make all the squares in the grid flash.

use a constructor to create audio instance objects and assign to click events

level up functionality - how would this work?

pulsating lights - http://jsoverson.github.io/jquery.pulse.js/
rotate lights
make responsive

switch color scheme mode

logic so that if reset the messages change to something different than loadup messages.


split the code up into smaller scripts? 

if game won twice (by p1 and p2) then 

jquery flip on clicked tile?

counter for remaining tiles left

animate the remaining tiles and turn numbers by making them bold on each mouse click

sound retro beep on mouse click
sounds short click on mouse hover

scrolling baclground image

on win header gets biggers and flies into middle of screen

on win, the tiles fade Out and a z-index hidden div comes up to congratulate user


//work out how player 2 will play - player 1 goes first and after the first click a timer starts counting down. player 1's turn will end once the timer has run out, at which point their turn score will be logged to compare against player 2's if neither manages to win) . if the timer runs out before the hasWon function has returned true then player ones turn has ended and its onto player two.

//add timer function which starts from the first mouse click. then wokrk out how the game is actually won - ie by least number of moves? or by best time with completed
// add a reset board button 
UX:

on load, create a div which covers most of screen explaining instructions and an okay button. On button click fade the div into the background/change the z-index. alternatively instead of okay button have a button which chooses grid size.

sketch how i want page to look with what interactive features- scoreboards, links to social media - tweet your score, player indicator, animations, z-index hidden divs and how they come onto & off screen.


an ambient color changer based upon the click/tilesRemaining ratio - will change depending on ratio


color themes: dark background -black grey hues. grid looks much better like this!

tweak ambient colors in abient.js
