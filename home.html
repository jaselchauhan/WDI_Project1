1 - add z index divs which fade in and out - consider UX for when to make divs visible and with what content.

2. a name! litesweeper?

3. user experience flow - sketch out how i want page to look like, (consider responsive too) and then 

4. animation:
  a.when hasWon is true (ie when you;ve won) make all the squares in the grid flash.
  b) when you win a message cascades across screen and then fades out
  c) consider other animations based on flow of how user would interact.

5. sound: use a constructor to create audio instance objects and assign to click events
  b) sound retro beep on mouse click
  sounds short click on mouse hover

6. how the game should actually work - ie. do you run out of turns?  if so how many? how does player 2 come into the mix? one idea is to have a turn counter which counts down and displays the clicks left for level. if level completed (all green) before this turn counter is up then level is won and score is logged. then p2's turn. if player 2 also wins then compare their turns left score and decide winner. then move onto the next level (ie. increase grid size). 

on load, create a div which covers most of screen explaining instructions and an okay button. On button click fade the div into the background/change the z-index. alternatively instead of okay button have a button which chooses grid size.

sketch how i want page to look with what interactive features- scoreboards, links to social media - tweet your score, player indicator, animations, z-index hidden divs and how they come onto & off screen.

7. split the code up into smaller scripts? 

8. make responsive - have tested on chrome dev tools and works on an ipad. haven't considered media queries yet - on smaller screen shrink the ul container height and width and also the border design font size.

9. styling
  a) fonts
  b) color themes: dark background -black grey hues. grid looks much better like this! further note. add a couple of bright colors in there which wont clash with red or green

easter eggs:
switch color scheme mode
make button presses look better
logic so that if reset the messages change to something different than loadup messages.
scrolling background image?
on win header gets biggers and flies into middle of screen
an ambient color changer based upon the click/tilesRemaining ratio - will change depending on ratio
