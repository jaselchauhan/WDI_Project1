# WDI_Project1 - Litesweeper

## a mobile first, responsive logic game!


##How to Play:

The aim of the game is to turn the board from red to green by pressing on the lites.
There's a twist though - each click will toggle the clicked lite and also its adjacent lites green/red. 
The board needs to be all green to win before you run out of clicks. 
You have 3 lives and can reset the board if you wish but it'll cost you a life.


##Challenges I faced:
I found designing the game logic to accomodate different grid sizes to be the most challenging   aspect of designing Litesweeper. The challenge lied in defining the relationship between the clicked lite and its surrounding adjacent tiles. I managed to solve this and therefore the game is able to dynamically adapt to any grid size!

Considering the UX was also another challenging but fun to solve issue - I had to get my brain out of developer mode and into the mindset of the end user to fully understand how they would interact with the game.
